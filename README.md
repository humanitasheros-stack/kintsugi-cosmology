# Kintsugi Cosmology

**Kintsugi Cosmology: Integrated Rupture and Consciousness**  
A unified theoretical framework proposing that consciousness and being emerge not from preserved unity, but from the visible integration of rupture and fragmentation.

## What this is

Kintsugi Cosmology weaves together:

- quantum decoherence and cosmology  
- thermodynamics and the Free Energy Principle  
- Integrated Information Theory  
- archetypal and depth psychology  
- trauma neuroscience and large-scale brain networks  
- the Pauli–Jung psychoid concept and synchronicity  

The central thesis:  
consciousness arises at the junction where broken symmetry maintains irreducible integrated information — across physical, biological, psychological, and cognitive scales.
